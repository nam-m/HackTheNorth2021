# HackTheNorth2021

Inspiration
We probably do not donate as much as we would love to, and we often ask why. As Winston Churchill once said, ”We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.” One of the problems with donating is that the donators often do not know where their donations go or if their donations went to waste. To address this problem, we built an our Android app that allows the user to donate and receive "thank you messages" by the receivers. With Covid around, we also do not know which charity is still accepting donation, so we built a map that allows users to see which charity accept the items they are donating.

What it does
Giftbox allows users to create donation post/listing with through taking picture of the item and detects the item you are donating. Giftbox, through its use of Google api, automatically prompts you the closest charities for the corresponding donating items of your choice. Points and achievement system is built-in the app that allows users to unlock new level, once certain points are reached, our partnered sponsors will award users with coupons.

How we built it
First, Betty, our UI/UX designer designed the app's wireframes. We, then, split off where Ben worked mostly in Android Studio to build Giftbox's frontend with Android Studio, Nam worked on both the frontend and backend of the applications, and specifically, deployed Google's API to implement map and search function. Yi worked on the Azure machine learning model tool and trained his own's python model to detect object and label the item for donating.
